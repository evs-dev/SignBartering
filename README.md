##### Step 6 - Anyone can now right click the sign with enough payment to purchase from your shop!

##### Step 7 - The items in your container will get automatically removed and placed in the buyer's inventory, and their payment will be placed in the same container. This is why it is important that there is enough space in the container for payment. It is impossible to open the container of a shop you do not own.
